                My name is Jeffrey Neal Crump.  I grew up in a small farming town called Turkey, Texas.  I am the middle child.  I have an older sister and a younger brother.  My high school was small.  I had 27 people in my graduating class.  I grew up wanting to be a professional football player.  I played football in high school but I blew out my knee when I was a senior.  That was the end of my dreams of playing football at the professional level.  <br><br>I have been working in Information Technology for more than 20 years.  When I started in technology a person used a dumb terminal to make requests for data that was processed by a mainframe.  I was there when server technology was introduced and businesses started migrating to client-server architecture.  I have also witnessed the return of the terminal-mainframe architecture with the popularity of cell phones and small portable devices.  I work hard to keep up with technology and help you keep in touch with the latest trends and technologies.
